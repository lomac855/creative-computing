    <h2><font face="futura">An Interview w/ Cole Masaki: on Digital Design</font></h2>
<strong><font face="futura">What is Digital Design to You?</font></strong>
<br>
<font face="caslon">Creating/designing on an digital platform.</font>

<p>
<strong><font face="futura">How Did You Start?</font></strong>
<br>
<font face="caslon">Well, when I was four I used to use <em>MS Paint</em> with my mum
everyday and I loved drawing on the computer and when I was nine I really wanted to make
action movies so I would take frames from <em>iMovie</em> and add effects to them on <em>Photoshop</em>
. That's when I really began to explore <em>Adobe After Effects</em> and from there I have had a
passion for learning new programmes and all their capabilities.</font>

<p>
<strong><font face="futura">What's Your Favourite Thing to Create?</font></strong>
<br>
<font face="caslon">I really enjoy all kinds of 2D and 3D work but I tend to gravitate towards
projects that are more surrealistic.</font>

<p>
<strong><font face="futura">Where do You Find Inspiration?</font></strong>
<br>
<font face="caslon">I like to think that I draw inspiration from everywhere. Any kind of media
or object can be the inspiration for a project and I don't want to limit myself to any one source
of inspiration.</font>

<p>
<strong><font face="futura">Where do You Find Inspiration?</font></strong>
<br>
<font face="caslon"><a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/1364">Salvador Dal√≠</a>,
  <a href="http://ondrejzunka.com/">Ondrej Zunka</a> and
  <a href="https://www.kimjunggius.com/">Kim Jung Gi</a>.</font>

<p>
<strong><font face="futura">Would You Call Yourself an Artist or a Designer?</font></strong>
<br>
<font face="caslon">A Designer. Rather than making stand alone pieces I prefer a line of work
where I can help people realise an idea.</font>
