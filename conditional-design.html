    <h2><font face="futura">How It Works</font></h2>
    <font face="futura"><em>3 players are each assigned a different shape
      (squares, lines and circles or arrows).
    <p><font face="futura">
    1. During each turn (lasting only 10 sec) a player begins to draw a part of
  an animal. <font color="red">Only one part must be drawn: i.e. ears, nose or leg.</font>
    <br> 2. The next player must add on by then drawing another body part of the animal
  they think is being drawn. <font color="red">Must be a part of the animal but
  does not have to link to the previous part drawn.</font>
    <br> 3. Repeat until a fully formed animal can be seen.</font></em></p>
<h3><font face="futura">First Attempt</font></h3>
<font face="futura">I gave the players too much time to complete their part which led to
  one of them drawing a fully formed figure within the 30 seconds so I modified it to 10.</font>
